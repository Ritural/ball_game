#Ball Game!

##How to play.

The ball moves on the y axis on it's own.

You control the ball's x axis by tilting the phone left and right.

The aim of the game is to collect balls of the same colour as yourself.

Every time you collect a ball of the same colour you get points, consecutive collisions with the right coloured ball earns you more points.

Each time the player ball hits the top and bottom of the screen it changes colour to whatever colour the rectangle was before hitting it.

Each time you collide with a wrong coloured ball you reset your score chain and lose a life.

There is a moving ball which when collided with if the same colour removes all balls of that colour.

Score is located at the top of the screen, and life at the bottom.

##Why

This is my personal project for getting to know Android Studio and my attempt to get into app development.
My plan is to add in some extra features described below and eventually get my game onto the Play Store.

##Future Plans

* Change it so instead of constantly moving on the y axis, the player controls both the x and y axis.
* Have the player wrap around the screen, if moving of the left side they appear from the right side.
* Change difficulty so that the game only starts with 2 colours then gets harder by introducing more colours.
* Change the indicating rectangles at the top and bottom of the screen to slowly move around the outside of the screen. 
- Movement will be in random directions.
* Add life powerup.
* Save functionality.
* CHANGE THE COLOUR SCHEME!!!
* Add app icons.
* Come up with a better name :)
* Everything else I haven't thought of yet.
* Make size of shapes relative to screen size.

##How to deploy

I used my S5 for testing so anything with a screen size of roughly 1080x1920 will work.

Once you install from Android Studio the name is called "AwesomeGame"
